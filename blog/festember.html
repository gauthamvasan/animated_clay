                    <p>My facebook feed is filled with amazing videos and posters about the events and highlights of the 42nd edition of Festember, the cultural extravaganza hosted annually in the month of September by NIT Trichy. With every post I see, I take longer walks down memory lane and smile to myself about the fun we had. The NIT Trichy peeps know the current festember as some grand event with the best artists performances and sponsors which could clash head on with the major college festival hosted by IITs. But just a few years back, it wasn't like that. I'm going to tell you the story of its  transformation. The exponential growth from 2011 and the vision we had. I joined in 2011 and my first experience with Festember wasn't so great. Sure, it was a decent festival, but it was no way close to Saarang. It was a huge letdown for me. But the story doesn't end there. You see, we were all young, restless and naive enough to take NO for an answer. "There is a thin line of difference in being courageous and foolish". I badly wanted to be a part of the Marketing team and after 2 group discussions and 3 gruelling hour long interviews, I made it to one of the most elite/competitve clubs on campus - the Festember Marketing team. We were a bunch of rag tag students who didn't care that Trichy was a sleepy town which didn't deserve the status of a city, it didn't matter that it had a crappy climate or not as well connected and hip as Chennai/Bangalore. We wanted a festival that people would line up to attend. We wanted a grand festival which could go toe to toe with Saarang and someday be better than Saarang.

                <p> Being a part of Festember is one huge crash course on life lessons. I have a deep admiration and respect for the people I worked with over 3 years of my Festember trajectory. Its an amazing feeling you know - to have people to look up to and know that he/she is gonna make a big splash and carve a niche for themselves in the outside world. Festember helped me grow into a better person and try to be the best that I vould be. We pushed the limits of the festuival, took huge risks (which paid off!) and created a platform for the juniors. The pioneers of Festember started a legacy in 1975 and we've been building upon it.   </p>

                <p>To the organizers who are sleep deprived and feel disheartened now, think about this real life scenario we faced in 2015 - A student who  shall remain unnamed, may god rest his soul, committed suicide a day before the fest - Media nightmare, full press on campus, we might have to cancel the fest!; Jayalalitha was arrested on the 2nd day and Trichy is in lockdown, our students are stuck in the airport; Due to the arrest and unsafe conditions in Trichy, singer Haricharan pulls out a day before his performance (we got to know by midnight), the judge for Fashion show pulls out last minute after all publicity material with her picutres; Extremely heavy rains - the ceiling plastic in Golden Jubilee Convention Centre/ OAT breaks and there's water pouring on stage and everywhere else. Some water falls on LCD screen - if it stops working we might have to repay the whole cost (it's in crores!). Think about how cool headed and hard hearted we had to be to handle all that. Remember that a few legends walked the same halls before you and get inspired! </p>

                <p> Marketing trips, OC trips and highlights. Long talks with Pranay, Pahal and Ayush. The scooty triples with Cibi and Dingra. The late night talks with Santosh, Chandra, Jonty. Walkie talkies.  </p>
