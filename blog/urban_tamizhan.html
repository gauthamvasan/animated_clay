                                    <p align='justify'><b>P.S:</b> I'm hoping that you (my dear reader) would overlook the irony of writing an article in English about my Tamil identity. My reasons for doing so would be obvious in the next couple of paragraphs. I might ramble ahead to a point that I feel is important. You might find these digressions charming, distracting or just shoddy writing. Either way, I hope this resonates with you on some level. </p>
                                                                                                            
                                    <p align='justify'><i>Who am I?</i> A simple question we answer with ease during a conversation, but struggle with philosophically. Don't worry, I won't bore you with my unfounded, illogical philosophical claims in this post. However, I do believe that our experiences make us who we are. And most of my impressionable years were spent in Tamil Nadu, India. I love the chapter in Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy where the computer says the answer to the life, the universe and everything is 42. The lesson I took away from it was that in order to get the right answers, we need to ask the right questions. This is me, ruminating about my Tamil identity.</p>

                                    <h2>A bit of my background</h2>
				
                                    <p align='justify'>I was born and raised in Chennai (சென்னை), Tamil Nadu, India. I look down on cities like Trichy, in fact I'd go one step further and claim that Trichy (திருச்சி) is not a city. It's hot, a lot more conservative and nothing is open after 9pm. Barring a few magnificent temples, mosques and churches, there's not much to do there. Coming to the point, I was one of the metropolitan city-breds who studied in an English medium school. Essentially, I'm yet another product of the CBSE system. As a convent educated idiot, my English is better than my Tamil. To elaborate, I speak better in Tamil, but I wouldn't last 5mins without using a couple of English words/phrases in between. I struggle when I try to write in Tamil. I do occasionally read books in Tamil, but I read much faster in English though.</p>                                    
                                    
                                    <center><blockquote>திரை கடல் ஓடியும் திரவியம் தேடு  (Go forth and venture across the oceans to find your fortunes)</blockquote></center>
                                    <!-- திரை கடலோடியும் துயரம் தேடு -->
                                    <p align='justify'>Avvaiyar(ஔவையார்), one of the most respected female tamil poets during the Sangam Tamil era penned this in 1st Century CE and it's still as relevant today as it was back then. Here I am, in Toronto, 13000+kms away seeking knowledge and fortune. I've been lucky enough to have visited 7+ countries so far (conferences, business and personal) and I'm grateful for it. Something about traveling gets you in a retrospective mood. It brings out the stuff you've been struggling with sub-consciously, memories buried deep inside. Ever since I moved to Canada, a small part of me has been screaming at the top if its lungs that I'm out of touch with my roots and history. I missed hearing Tamil in the background, I missed lazing around in the sultry weather eating fried, savory Indian snacks and most of all, I missed the people.</p>
                                    
                                    <p align='justify'>When I moved to Edmonton in August 2015, I had just graduated from NIT Trichy. One of my psychotic thesis advisors had screwed me over my grade and I was fuming about our abysmal education system. In fact, I couldn't wait to get out and see the world. I was excited about taking new courses taught by AAAI fellows. I was finally going to get teachers who were more interested in education rather than dress code and "discipline". Everything western seemed better (the grass felt greener on the other side). I was frustrated with everything broken in India, especially Tamil Nadu and I couldn't wait to pursue the American Dream (Technically, in Canada, but it's still like a smaller, more polite brother of the USA).</p> 
                                    
                                    <center><blockquote>This too shall pass...</blockquote></center>
                                    
                                    <p align='justify'>And surely it did. The novelty wore off after a couple of months. My academic life was fantastic, but my social life almost non-existent. I did meet a lot of nice, interesting people from different countries, but I still missed my friends. My music library which usually had classic and psychedelic rock, metal and top 40 crap was undergoing a transition. I started downloading older Tamil songs. I don't mean just Ilayaraja, it went as far as M.S. Viswanathan, P.B. Srinivas and a couple others. My top 25 most played songs were 90% Tamil now and the highlight of my day was watching an 80s Bhagyaraj movie, old comedy scenes involving Goundamani, Senthil, Vivek, Karthik or Vadivelu, or a cult scene from Thevar Magan, Padayappa, Nayakan, etc. I used to revel in joys of Tamil lyrics and poetry. to It's amazing how I derived the greatest pleasure from the smallest things - an old tamil movie, jotting down poetry in Tamil, an obscure tamil song, Kamal Haasan's unbelievable command over Tamil, etc. I'd listen to Tamil rhetoric spewed by politicians just to hear them talk without using one English word. It was unbelievable to witness. I couldn't talk for 5mins without a couple dozen English words interspersed in between.</p>                                
                                    
                                    <p align='justify'>Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my command over English. While I don't speak as well as I'd like to (apparently, I speak like an immigrant who moved here during high school, which is pretty good, but not good enough for me), my writing is well above-average. If I put my mind to it, I'm sure I could stand toe to toe with Shashi Tharoor and have an engaging conversation. But the embarrassing part for me is that my command over Tamil is not even close. I was just another brick in the wall manufactured by the Macaulay education system in India. While I spoke in Tamil with my friends, I was writing in English, reading English fiction and completely happy to stop learning Tamil as a subject after 10th grade. My only saving grace was that I didn't directly equate command over English to class and intellect (the reason why deserves an article of its own). I don't pull the crap that a lot of techies/MNC employees in India do. If I'm talking to someone who knows Tamil, I speak to them in Tamil even if they respond only in English (Yes, there are lots of Indians out there who take pride in the fact that they prefer English over their native tongue). Command over a language is definitely sexy - it's intellectually appealing. But the language could be anything. </p>
                                    
                                    <!--
                                    <p align='justify'>Getting back to the subject, I've been trying to figure out what it means to be a Tamilian. Is it enough if I have a good command over the language? But that doesn't sound right. Knowing English doesn't make me British. So what about people who have lived in the region for a long time? There are plenty of Indians from the north who settled in Chennai, but still can't speak the language. I have no qualms about calling them Chennaites, but Is can't call them Tamilians. And    </p>

                                    <h2>Time to start improving my Tamizh</h2>
                                    
                                    <p align='justify'> First step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. I may have realized this a little later than I should have, but I intend to take incremental steps towards building my knowledge of Thamizh. I have started reading books, blogs and articles in Tamil. I have plans to write a bunch of posts in Tamil, create posts with song lyrics in Tamil, etc. Maybe not the best way to go about it, but it's currently the most feasible option for me. </p>
                                    
                                    <center><blockquote>தமிழன் என்று சொல்லடா தலை நிமிர்ந்து நில்லடா... (Call yourself Tamil, hold your head high with pride)</blockquote></center>
                                                        
                                    
                                    <p align='justify'> An oft-repeated quote in Dravidian identity politics. I don't believe in taking pride in things I'm not directly responsible for. My Tamil identity started out as an accident of birth. There's a certain elegance, charm, a beauty if you will to the language. And I can definitely take pride if my command over Tamil is extraordinary, if my Tamilian experience shapes me into a better person. I've come to peace with my identity as a <i>urban tamizhan</i>. While probably not as charismatic as the protagonists in Mani Ratnam's or Gautham Vasudev Menon's movies, my upbringing is closer to urban, middle-class upbringing portrayed in their films. I guess its time to start devoting a considerable portion of my mental faculties towards improving my Tamil. </p>
                                        
                                    <p align='justify'> To my Tamil readers, I'm going to leave you with an excerpt from one of my favourite poems by Mahakavi Bharthiyar (மஹாகவி பாரதியார்).

                                    <p align='justify'> It is important to keep in mind that Bharathiyar lived from 1882-1921. He started publishing poems regularly in Tamil weekly newspapers in 1907 and wrote quite a bit about Russian, French revolutions, relationship between God and Man, etc. If you were a little alarmed by the nationalist tone of the poem, remember that this was written when India was under the rule of the British empire. India was under the yoke of the colonial masters, the men and women subjected to unbelievable horrors and treated like savages. Given the context, I'm surprised he managed to keep the hatred out of this poem. He penned such passionate verses in Tamil - so much so that they still reverberate in Tamil consciousness. Movies still reference his work, politicians mis-quote him for their selfish gains, men & women are still inspired by it! Words have power, and Bharathiyar wielded them with unbelievable panache and potency. It's high time I learn from the legendary Tamizhans who came before me. </p>
