                                    <p align='justify'><b>P.S:</b> I'm hoping that you (my dear reader) would overlook the irony of writing an article in English about my Tamil Identity. My reasons for doing so would be obvious in the next couple of paragraphs. I might ramble ahead to a point that I feel is important. You might find these digressions charming or distracting. Either way, I hope this resonates with you on some level. </p>
                                                                                                            
                                    <p align='justify'><i>Who am I?</i> A simple question we answer with ease during a conversation, but struggle with philosophically. Don't worry, I won't bore you with my unfounded, illogical philosophical claims in this post. However, I do believe that our experiences make us who we are. And most of my impressionable years were spent in Tamil Nadu, India. I love the chapter in Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy where the computer says the answer to the life, the universe and everything is 42.   </p>

                                    <h2>A series of events that led to the search for my Tamil identity</h2>
                                    
                                    
                                    <center><blockquote>திரை கடலோடியும் துயரம் தேடு (Go forth and venture across the oceans to find your fortunes)</blockquote></center>
                                    
                                    <p align='justify'>Avvaiyar(ஔவையார்), one of the most respected female tamil poets during the Sangam Tamil era penned this in 1st Century CE and it's still as relevant today as it was back then. Here I am, in Toronto, 13000+kms away seeking knowledge and fortune. I've been lucky enough to have visited 7+ countries so far (conferences, business and personal) and I'm grateful for it. Something about traveling gets you in a retrospective mood. It brings out the stuff you've been struggling with sub-consciously, memories buried deep inside. Ever since I moved to Canada, a small part of me has been screaming at the top if its lungs that I'm out of touch with my roots and history. I missed hearing Tamil in the background, I missed lazing around in the sultry weather eating fried, savory Indian snacks and most of all, I missed the people.</p>
                                    
                                    <p align='justify'>When I moved to Edmonton in August 2015, I had just graduated from NIT Trichy. One of my psychotic thesis advisors had screwed me over my grade and I was fuming about our absymal education system. In fact, I couldn't wait to get out and see the world. I was excited about taking new courses taught by AAAI fellows. I was finally going to get teachers who were more interested in education rather than dress code. Everything western seemed better (the grass felt greener on the other side). TL;DR: I was frustrated with everything broken in India, especially Tamil Nadu and I couldn't wait to pursue the American Dream (Technically, in Canada, but it's still like a smaller, more polite brother of the USA).</p> 
                                    
                                    <center><blockquote>This too shall pass...</blockquote></center>
                                    
                                    <p align='justify'>And surely it did. The novelty wore off after a couple of months. My academic life was fantastic, but my social life almost non-existent. I did meet a lot of nice, intersting people from different countries, but I still missed my friends. My music library which usually had classic rock, metal and top 40 crap was undergoing a transition. I started downloading older Tamil songs. I don't mean just Ilayaraja, it went as far as M.S. Viswanathan, P.B. Srinivas and a couple others. My top 25 most played songs were 90% Tamil now and the highlight of my day was watching an 80s Bhagyaraj movie. It's amazing how I derived the greatest pleasure from the smallest things - an old tamil movie, jotting down poetry in Tamil, an obsure tamil song, Kamal Haasan's unbelievable command over Tamil, etc. I'd listen to Tamil rhetoric spewed by politicians just to hear them talk without using one English word. It was unbelievable to witness. I couldn't talk for 5mins without a couple dozen English words interspersed in between.</p>                                
                                    
                                    <p align='justify'>Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my command over English. While I don't speak as well as I'd like (apparently, I speak like an immigrant who moved here for high school, which is pretty good, but not good enough for me), my writing is well above-average. If I put my mind to it, I'm sure I could stand toe to toe with Shashi Tharoor and have an engaging conversation. But the embarassing part for me is that my command over Tamil is not even close. I was just another brick in the wall manufactured by the Macaulay education policy in India. While I spoke in Tamil with my friends, I was writing in English, reading English fiction and completely happy to stop learning Tamil as a subject after 10th grade. My only saving grace was that I didn't directly equate command over English to class and intellect (the reason why deserves an artice of its own).   </p>
                                    
                                    <p align='justify'>Getting back to the subject, I've been trying to figure out what it means to be a Tamilian. Is it enough if I have a good command over the language? But that doesn't sound right. Knowing English doesn't make me British. So what about people who have lived in the region for a long time? There are plenty of Indians from the north who settled in Chennai, but still can't speak the language. I have no qualms about calling them Chennaites, but I can't call them Tamilians. And    </p>
