		<blockquote> ...the secret of the Great Stories is that they have no secrets. The Great Stories are the ones you have heard and want to hear again. The ones you can enter anywhere and inhabit comfortably. They don’t deceive you with thrills and trick endings. They don’t surprise you with the unforeseen. They are as familiar as the house you live in. Or the smell of your lover’s skin. You know how they end, yet you listen as though you don’t. In the way that although you know that one day you will die, you live as though you won’t. In the Great Stories you know who lives, who dies, who finds love, who doesn’t. And yet you want to know again.

That is their mystery and their magic.”
― Arundhati Roy, The God of Small Things </blockquote>

		 <p> It's been over 8 years since the theatrical release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaaranam_Aayiram"> Vaaranam Aayiram </a>. It was one of the few movies I watched with my parents and relatives in a theatre. I was in 9th grade when and still grappling with the quirks and contradictions of life. It was pretty strange experience when I walked out of the movie. I was among the select few who quite liked the movie. Sure, the movie performed well commercially and made many call their dad, but it had mixed reviews at best. </p>

		<p> Vaaranam Aayiram is Surya established himself as a brilliant actor and Gautham Menon was finally one of the biggest directors in the industry. </p>


		<p> The character Meghna (portrayed by Sameera Reddy) brought to life in the movie was the kind of girl almost completely unrepresented in Indian cinema. She's my kind of girl. She's super smart, classy and gorgeous in the girl next door sort of way. In most of the Tamil movies, the girls are either annoying and bubbly or a headstrong bitch who needs to be tamed by the hero. When Meghna tells Surya that she's expecting 99% average and is off to study in UC Berkeley, I fell in love with the . I was hopelessly smitten by her for a while until I saw Sameera Reddy act in a forgettable movie starring Ajith. </p>



                    <blockquote>I loved that Vaaranam Aayiram is a story about how a father has influenced his son’s life – even an action segment, which comes off at first as perfunctory heroics, culminates with the reunion of a father and his young son – and yet this father is himself no dazzling overachiever. Krishnan is an amiable loser, heavily in debt, heavily into bad habits, but also heavily in love with his family. He’s the kind of character who invites you to love him not because he’s flawless, but despite his flaws. When he drops his son off at college for the first time, there’s no stentorian fatherly instruction to study well or be a good boy. Krishnan merely remarks that they’re both grown ups now, and implicit in this observation is that Suriya will have to make his own mistakes.
